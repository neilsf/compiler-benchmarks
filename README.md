# compiler-benchmarks
Benchmarks to test how XC=BASIC and other compilers to each other.
## Disclaimer
This is a community project, might be full of mistakes, inefficient algorithms, etc. Make it better. Fork it, add your own code and send a PR.
## Rules
In each directory you'll find an algorithm written in pseudo-code.

1. Try to implement the code in any language. Any optimizations are allowed if the algorithm remains the same.
2. Mark benchmark points in code
3. Name your file {algorithm}-{language}.{lang-specific-extension}
4. Include the compiled binary (except CBM BASIC where BASIC listing is enough)
5. Comment benchmark results in your code as well as in the README file.

You can add new algorithms. In this case please provide a README file in the respective directory.
